# TOPSIS-Based Selection of Best Pre-trained Model for Text Sentence Similarity

#### Author: Kaavya Dhir | Roll No. 102317251 | Predictive Analytics Assignment-5

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a structured evaluation framework to identify the optimal pre-trained Sentence Transformer model for **Text Sentence Similarity** tasks using the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** multi-criteria decision-making method.

Instead of selecting a model purely based on accuracy, this approach evaluates multiple performance indicators and ranks models based on overall suitability.

## 📑 Evaluation Metrics Used

The following criteria were used to build the decision matrix:

| Metric               | Description                       | Impact |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Spearman Correlation | Correlation with human similarity | +      |
| MSE                  | Mean Squared Error                | -      |
| Throughput           | Sentences processed per second    | +      |
| Model Size (MB)      | Storage size of model             | -      |

Impact Rules:

- `+` → Higher is better
- `-` → Lower is better

## 📈 Visual Analysis

This section interprets the saved plots generated during evaluation.

---

### 1️⃣ Spearman Correlation Comparison

<img src="results/Spearman_comparison.png" width="700"/>

This chart compares how strongly each model's predictions correlate with human similarity judgments.

- Higher values indicate better semantic understanding.
- Transformer-based models typically perform strongly.
- However, highest correlation does not guarantee best overall deployment choice.

Since Spearman has the highest weight (0.4), it strongly influences the final ranking.

---

### 2️⃣ Mean Squared Error (MSE) Comparison

<img src="results/MSE_comparison.png" width="700"/>

This plot shows prediction error.

- Lower MSE means predictions are closer to human scores.
- Some models may have high correlation but slightly higher error.
- This demonstrates why multi-criteria evaluation is important.

---

### 3️⃣ Throughput Comparison (Speed)

<img src="results/Throughput_comparison.png" width="700"/>

Throughput measures inference efficiency.

- Lightweight MiniLM variants are significantly faster.
- Larger models sacrifice speed for marginal accuracy gains.
- In real-world systems, speed is critical for scalability.

---

### 4️⃣ Model Size Comparison

<img src="results/Size_comparison.png" width="700"/>

Model size affects:

- Deployment feasibility
- Memory usage
- Cloud cost

Smaller models are better suited for edge and production environments.

---

### 5️⃣ TOPSIS Ranking

<img src="results/topsis_ranking.png" width="700"/>

This plot shows the final TOPSIS scores.

- The model with the highest score ranks 1.
- TOPSIS balances accuracy, error, speed, and efficiency.
- The top-ranked model provides the best overall trade-off.

---

### 6️⃣ Decision Matrix Heatmap

<img src="results/decision_matrix_heatmap.png" width="700"/>

The heatmap visualizes relative performance across metrics.

- Warmer colors indicate stronger metric performance.
- Helps quickly compare strengths and weaknesses.
- Demonstrates why some high-accuracy models rank lower overall due to efficiency trade-offs.

---

## ⚖️ TOPSIS Configuration

Weights used:
[0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]

Meaning:

- Spearman → 40%
- MSE → 20%
- Throughput → 20%
- Size → 20%

This prioritizes semantic accuracy while still considering efficiency and deployability.
